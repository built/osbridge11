Notes and content from my Graphviz talk at Open Source Bridge 2011.

There were no slides, so if you missed the talk you'll only find some demo DOT files and a bit of sample code here. It may still be interesting! The talk *was* recorded. Hopefully you'll have access to that soon.

A big thanks to Ward Cunningham and Markus Roberts for the extra examples and again to Ward for showing me how to make Graphviz dance.

Thanks again to everyone who came out for the talk.
