A great demo of Graphviz. Data taken from the wonderful collection of "Real-World Data Sets" at http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/data/.

The data and the corresponding DOT file list all of the states in the US along with all of the other states which they touch.

For best effect when showing others, make sure that Graphviz renders in hierarchical layout mode. Once the graph is loaded, switch to Energy Minimized layout and watch the magic happen.
