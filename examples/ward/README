This is an example pulled from Ward Cunningham's NSD project. In that project he revists Fortran IV source code that he wrote in the mid-70s. With a little bit of Perl he's been able to generate DOT files. Graphviz renders those DOT files as complex and fascinating diagrams showing the execution flow of those early programs. See https://github.com/wardcunningham/nsd for the full project.
