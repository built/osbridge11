GraphViz is an open source program for displaying the structure of data. We’ll discuss:

 * Graphs, GraphViz, and DOT, the data format that drives GraphViz
 * How to peer inside of a running system with a little bit of code and a whole lot of GraphViz
 * Debugging and state modeling techniques for programmers
 * Techniques for finding patterns in data sets.
 * Problems with GraphViz

Developers! Say goodbye to println debugging

Analysts! Find simple ways to look at systems and data.

Suits! Find patterns and opportunities you didn’t know were there.

Aesthetes! See the natural beauty of data.
